<p>In order to do this homework I did the folowing steps:  </p>
<p>I have created 3 VMS. On the first one I have installed through ansible nginx and I have set it up as a load balancer.</p>
<p>On the second and third VM's I have installed through ansible httpd.</p>
<p>I've shut down VM3, and after that the load balancer is pointing only to VM2.</p>
<p>Scale up the existing VMs to 2 CPUs and 1GB RAM. </p>
<p>Perform through ansible a deployment of the local HTML files to the servers.</p>
